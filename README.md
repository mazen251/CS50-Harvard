# CS50x Completion

Welcome to my CS50x repository! This repository contains all my work from the CS50x course, including problem sets (psets) and notes from each week of the course.

## Course Overview

CS50x is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. It covers topics such as algorithms, data structures, memory management, web development, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by weeks, with each week represented by its own folder. Inside each folder, you'll find the problem sets for that week along with a `README.md` file containing my notes and reflections on the topics covered.

## How to Navigate

To explore my work, simply navigate to the folder of the week you're interested in. Each folder contains:
- The problem sets (`psets`) I completed for that week.
- A `README.md` file with detailed notes on the week's topics, challenges faced, and insights gained.

## Final Thoughts

Completing CS50x was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It provided a solid foundation in computer science and programming, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
